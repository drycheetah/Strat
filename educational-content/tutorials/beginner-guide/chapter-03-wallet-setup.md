# Chapter 3: Setting Up Your STRAT Wallet

## What is a Cryptocurrency Wallet?

A cryptocurrency wallet is software that:
- Stores your private keys (your password to your funds)
- Displays your balances
- Sends and receives transactions
- Interacts with blockchain applications

**Important**: Wallets don't actually "store" cryptocurrency - they store the keys to access your blockchain assets.

## Types of Wallets

### 1. Hot Wallets (Internet-Connected)
**Web Wallets**: Access through browsers
- Pros: Convenient, easy to use
- Cons: Less secure than cold storage
- Best for: Daily transactions, small amounts

**Mobile Wallets**: Apps on your phone
- Pros: Portable, user-friendly
- Cons: Vulnerable if phone is compromised
- Best for: On-the-go transactions

**Desktop Wallets**: Software on your computer
- Pros: More control, better security
- Cons: Tied to one device
- Best for: Regular users, medium amounts

### 2. Cold Wallets (Offline Storage)
**Hardware Wallets**: Physical devices
- Pros: Maximum security
- Cons: Cost, less convenient
- Best for: Large holdings, long-term storage

**Paper Wallets**: Keys printed on paper
- Pros: Completely offline
- Cons: Can be lost or damaged
- Best for: Long-term cold storage

## Setting Up Your First Wallet

### Step 1: Choose Your Wallet Type
For this tutorial, we'll use the STRAT Web Wallet.

### Step 2: Visit the Official Website
Navigate to **wallet.strat.io** (always verify the URL!)

**Security Warning**: Bookmark the official site. Beware of phishing sites!

### Step 3: Create New Wallet
Click "Create New Wallet"

### Step 4: Create a Strong Password
Your password should:
- Be at least 12 characters long
- Include uppercase and lowercase letters
- Include numbers and symbols
- NOT be used anywhere else
- NOT contain personal information

**Example of strong password**: `Tr4$hP@nd4_2026!Strat`

### Step 5: Save Your Recovery Phrase

**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP!**

You'll receive 12-24 words called a "recovery phrase" or "seed phrase."

**Example recovery phrase:**
```
wisdom battle purple cloud donate truck stable mountain
curious planet tiger umbrella achieve
```

### CRITICAL SECURITY RULES:

1. **Write it down on paper** (never digital)
2. **Store in a safe place** (fireproof safe, safety deposit box)
3. **NEVER share with anyone** (not even STRAT support)
4. **Make multiple copies** (keep in separate locations)
5. **Never take screenshots** (can be hacked)
6. **Never store in cloud** (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)

**Why it matters**: Your recovery phrase IS your wallet. Anyone with this phrase can access all your funds.

### Step 6: Verify Your Recovery Phrase
The wallet will ask you to confirm words from your phrase. This ensures you wrote it down correctly.

### Step 7: Complete Setup
Your wallet is now ready to use!

## Understanding Your Wallet Interface

### Dashboard Overview
**Balance Display**: Shows your STRAT holdings

**Address**: Your public receiving address
- Example: `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb`
- Safe to share publicly
- Like your email address for crypto

**Transaction History**: Recent sends and receives

**Portfolio**: Value of all your assets

### Navigation Menu

## Security Best Practices

### Password Management

- Use different passwords for each service

### Device Security

- Be wary of unsolicited messages

### Common Scams to Avoid

**Giveaway Scams**: "Send 1 STRAT, get 10 back!"
- Reality: You'll lose your STRAT

**Support Impersonators**: "I'm from STRAT support, send me your seed phrase"
- Reality: Real support NEVER asks for seed phrases

**Fake Apps**: Malicious wallet apps in app stores
- Reality: Only download from official sources

**Phishing Sites**: Fake websites that look real
- Reality: Always verify the URL

## Backing Up Your Wallet

### Multiple Backup Methods

**Method 1: Paper Backup**

- Use pencil (won't fade like ink)
- Store in waterproof, fireproof container
- Keep in safe or safety deposit box

**Method 2: Metal Backup**
- Engrave seed phrase on metal plate
- Resistant to fire, water, corrosion
- Available from crypto hardware stores

**Method 3: Split Storage**
- Divide seed phrase into parts
- Store parts in different locations
- Requires multiple parts to reconstruct

**Method 4: Cryptosteel/Metal Devices**
- Commercial products designed for seed storage

## Wallet Recovery
