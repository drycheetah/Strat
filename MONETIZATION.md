# 💰 STRAT Monetization Guide

## Ways to Make Money from STRAT (Age 16+, No SSN Required)

### 1. Bridge Fees (PASSIVE INCOME - Automated!) ⚡

**How it works:**
- Every time someone converts SOL → STRAT, you collect a fee
- Default: 2% of every conversion
- Fees automatically sent to your wallet
- **100% passive once set up**

**Setup:**
1. Create a STRAT wallet to collect fees (mine some blocks first)
2. Add to Railway environment variables:
   ```
   BRIDGE_FEE_PERCENT=2
   BRIDGE_FEE_WALLET=STRAT[your wallet address]
   ```
3. That's it! Fees collect automatically

**Income potential:**
- 10 users × 1 SOL each × 2% = 0.2 SOL worth of STRAT per batch
- At $140/SOL = $28 in STRAT
- Scale with marketing!

### 2. Pre-Mine & Hold Strategy 📈

**What to do NOW:**
1. Mine as many blocks as possible while difficulty is low
2. Build up a treasury of 5,000-10,000 STRAT
3. As project grows and price increases, sell OTC

**Why this works:**
- Early blocks are easy (low difficulty)
- You control the blockchain - mine whenever
- Hold = potential value appreciation
- No costs, pure profit

**How to sell later:**
- Accept crypto (BTC, ETH, USDC) for STRAT
- Peer-to-peer trades
- Set your own price
