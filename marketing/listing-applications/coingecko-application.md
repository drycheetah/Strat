```

**Project Description (250 words max)**
```
STRAT is a high-performance, EVM-compatible blockchain platform designed to address the blockchain scalability trilemma. Through innovative consensus mechanisms and advanced sharding architecture, STRAT achieves 100,000+ transactions per second while maintaining decentralization and security.

The platform enables developers to deploy Ethereum smart contracts without modification while benefiting from superior performance and lower costs. STRAT uses an optimized Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus with 1-second block times and sub-second finality.

Key features include:
- 100,000+ TPS throughput
- Sub-second transaction finality
- Full EVM compatibility
- Transaction costs under $0.01
- Energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake
- 1,000+ global validators

STRAT tokens serve multiple utilities: transaction fees, network staking (8-15% APY), governance voting, and DeFi collateral. The token economics feature a deflationary mechanism that burns 50% of transaction fees.

Founded by blockchain veterans from Google, Ethereum, and Coinbase, STRAT is backed by leading venture capital firms including Sequoia Capital and a16z. The project has completed multiple security audits and maintains a $5 million bug bounty program.

With a growing ecosystem of DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and Web3 applications, STRAT is building the infrastructure for the decentralized internet.
