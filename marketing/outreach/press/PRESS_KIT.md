## FAQ for Press

**Q: What makes STRAT different?**
A: STRAT is built entirely from scratch with JavaScript smart contracts, making blockchain accessible to millions of existing developers without requiring them to learn new languages.

**Q: Is this another Ethereum fork?**
A: No. Every line of STRAT is original code, not forked from any existing blockchain.

**Q: How does STRAT ensure security?**
A: We use battle-tested cryptography (secp256k1), proof-of-work consensus, and the UTXO model proven by Bitcoin. All code is open source for public audit.

**Q: What's the token distribution?**
A: 100% fair launch via mining. No pre-mine, no ICO, no VC allocation. All STRAT comes from mining rewards.

**Q: Can anyone mine STRAT?**
A: Yes. STRAT is CPU-mineable from any computer. No specialized hardware required.

**Q: How do JavaScript smart contracts work?**
A: Contracts are written in JavaScript, sandboxed for security, and execute with gas metering to prevent abuse.

**Q: Is STRAT production-ready?**
A: Yes. Mainnet is live with real nodes processing real transactions.

**Q: How can developers get started?**
A: Visit our documentation at docs.stratblockchain.io for complete guides and examples.

## Boilerplate

**Short (50 words):**
STRAT is a proof-of-work blockchain built from scratch with JavaScript smart contracts. Featuring 10-second blocks, UTXO transactions, and a fair launch, STRAT makes blockchain development accessible to 13+ million JavaScript developers worldwide.

**Medium (100 words):**
STRAT is an innovative layer 1 blockchain platform built entirely from scratch, featuring proof-of-work consensus, Bitcoin-style UTXO transactions, and JavaScript-based smart contracts. Unlike projects that fork existing code, STRAT is original implementation designed to make blockchain development accessible to the world's 13+ million JavaScript developers. With 10-second block times, no pre-mine or ICO, and complete open-source transparency, STRAT represents a fair-launch approach to blockchain innovation. The platform enables developers to deploy smart contracts using familiar JavaScript syntax while maintaining the security and decentralization of proof-of-work consensus.

**Long (200 words):**
STRAT is a groundbreaking layer 1 blockchain platform that challenges the status quo by being built entirely from scratch rather than forking existing projects. At its core, STRAT features proof-of-work consensus similar to Bitcoin, providing robust security through computational difficulty, combined with a UTXO transaction model that offers enhanced privacy and parallel processing capabilities.

What truly sets STRAT apart is its use of JavaScript for smart contracts. While most blockchain platforms require developers to learn specialized languages like Solidity or Rust, STRAT empowers the world's 13+ million JavaScript developers to build on blockchain using skills they already possess. This dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for blockchain development.

The platform delivers impressive performance with 10-second block times, enabling fast transaction confirmations while maintaining network security. STRAT's fair launch philosophy means no pre-mining, no ICO, and no venture capital allocation - all tokens enter circulation through mining rewards, ensuring true decentralization from day one.

Built with Node.js and featuring a complete suite of developer tools including a web dashboard, CLI utilities, and RESTful APIs, STRAT provides everything needed to build, deploy, and manage blockchain applications. The project is fully open source, allowing complete transparency and community contribution.
