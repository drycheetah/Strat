## Slide 2: The Problem

### Blockchain's $3 Trillion Opportunity is Broken

**Current State:**
- 🐌 **Too Slow**: Ethereum processes only 15-30 TPS (Visa does 65,000+)
- 💸 **Too Expensive**: Gas fees hit $200+ during peak usage
- ⚡ **Too Wasteful**: Bitcoin uses more energy than Argentina
- 🔧 **Too Complex**: Poor developer experience limits innovation

**Result**: <1% of global population uses blockchain regularly

**The Market is Ready:**
- $2.3T crypto market cap
- 420M crypto users globally
- 84% annual growth in DeFi
- $10B+ institutional investment in 2025
