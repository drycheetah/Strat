This week: @CryptoDevMike

Mike migrated his Ethereum DeFi protocol to STRAT and saved his users
$2M in gas fees in just the first month!

"STRAT's EVM compatibility made migration seamless. My users are thrilled
with $0.01 transaction costs instead of $50. This is what DeFi should be."

Incredible impact! This is the STRAT difference. 💙

📚 LEARN SOMETHING NEW

Topic: How STRAT's Deflationary Mechanism Works

Every transaction on STRAT includes a small fee (average $0.01). Here's what
happens to that fee:

50% is permanently BURNED - removed from circulation forever. This reduces
the total supply over time, creating scarcity.

50% goes to VALIDATORS - rewarding those who secure the network.

With 10M+ daily transactions, that's 50,000+ STRAT burned per day! Over time,
this creates long-term value for holders while funding network security.

Key Takeaways:
• More usage = More burns = Greater scarcity
• Deflationary from day 1
• Transparent and automatic
• Benefits long-term holders
